# Bruno Lucena's portfolio

## Overview
Every designer knows how hard it is to find the time and build a concise, thoughful and updated portfolio. This class and Angie's class have given me the chance to stop and think about my portfolio. The goal of this project was to create a manageable portfolio that would be easy to update and that could grow over time. I think I managed to do that.

## What I learned from this project
First, I created too much content. Almost missed the dealine because I wanted to put 12 projects but was only able to produce 4...
I also learned that I have a long way to master mixins and sass. Sass is awesome but there are some features that I need to study more. I was not able to use media queries with mixins, for instance.
I absolutely need to study acessibility. Other than using alt, I discovered the "arias" but I didn't manage to study it thoroughly. I didn't even really consider it in this project.
